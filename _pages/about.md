Hello! My name is George.

I'm a data scientist and machine learning researcher, with a focus on natural
language processing and Bayesian modelling. I'm based in New York City and I
work for [Flatiron Health](https://flatiron.com/).

In my ~~copious~~ free time, I contribute to and maintain [several open-source
libraries](https://eigenfoo.xyz/work/#software) (particularly the [PyMC
project](https://github.com/pymc-devs)). Away from the keyboard, I spend my
time drinking coffee and accruing new hobbies (to date: cryptic crosswords,
bouldering, photography, mechanical keyboards...).

Previously, I worked for [Point72](https://www.point72.com) and
[Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/), and I studied engineering at [The
Cooper Union](http://cooper.edu/welcome).

## What's with your username?

It seemed clever at the time... but people keep asking, so maybe not.

_Eigen_ is a German for _own_, but probably a better translation (especially for math
terms like [eigenvalue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors))
would be _belonging to_. For example, an eigenvalue is the value _belonging to_ a
matrix.

_Foo_ is a [placeholder name in computer
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar), and is basically a techier version
of "stuff" or "thing".

So on one hand, my username is unique and belongs to me because its `eigen`, but on the
other hand its just a `foo`. The juxtaposition was funny to me.
