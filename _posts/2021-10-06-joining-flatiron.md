An exciting professional update: I’ve joined [Flatiron
Health](https://flatiron.com/) as a data scientist on their machine learning
team! I'll be working out of their SoHo offices, and so will continue to be
based in New York.

Flatiron Health is a technology company in the healthcare space, trying to
accelerate oncology research and improve quality of cancer care through data
analytics.

Needless to say, I'm looking forward to the adventures ahead! ⛵
